# Nauper
Nauper is a engine for visual novels based on web technologies.
Nauper uses HTML5 \<canvas> element for rendering and controlling it by JS.

# Code guide
We use ES5 syntax with some ES6 features.

JavaScript style guide: [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master)

ES6 translates to ES5 using Babel

# Engine structure
Okay, if you're there, I think you want to know about engine structure.
That's this:
* Character, functionality:
  * Giving object with links to images with characters sprites
* UI, functionality:
  * Background drawing
  * Textboxes drawing
  * Text drawing
* Frame, functionality:
  * Drawing characters on canvas
* Question, functionality:
  * Giving a choices to user, maximum is 4, they're redirecting user between scenes
* Engine, functionality:
  * Starting Frame's and Question's drawing
  * Handling clicks on canvas
  * Handling choices of Question

So, if you opened /src directory, you saw two more files.
That's what they are:
* utils.js, functions:
  * wrapText - function, needed by UI
  * getTextOffset - function, needed by UI too
  * putDefaults - function that expands given object with default object
* nauper.js, functionality:
  * In that file we can only see Nauper object definition
