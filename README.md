# Nauper
Nauper is a engine for visual novels based on web technologies.

Nauper uses HTML5 `<canvas>` element for rendering and controlling it by JS.

## Code guide
We use ES5 syntax with some ES6 features.

JavaScript style guide: [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master)

ES6 translates to ES5 using Babel

## Engine structure
Okay, if you're there, I think you want to know about engine structure.

That's this:
* **Character**, functionality:
  * Giving object with links to images with characters sprites
* **UI**, functionality:
  * Background drawing
  * Textboxes drawing
  * Text drawing
* **Frame**, functionality:
  * Drawing characters on canvas
* **Question**, functionality:
  * Giving a choices to user, maximum is 4, they're redirecting user between scenes
* **Engine**, functionality:
  * Starting **Frame**'s and **Question**'s drawing
  * Handling clicks on canvas
  * Handling choices of **Question**

So, if you opened /src directory, you saw two more files.

That's what they are:
* **utils.js**, functions:
  * wrapText - function, needed by **UI**
  * getTextOffset - function, needed by **UI** too
  * putDefaults - function that expands given object with default object
* **nauper.js**, functionality:
  * In that file we can only see **Nauper** object definition

## Nauper's functionality
You can draw background (oh, really?)
![Background setting](images/bg.png)

You can draw textboxes with text
![Default text](images/text_default.png)

Textboxes can be rounded
![Rounded text](images/text_rounded.png)

You can also change color of text
![Colored text](images/text_colors.png)

You can draw characters
![Characters](images/characters.png)

You can also draw characters and text at the same time
![Characters with text](images/characters_text.png)

You can create questions with maximum of four choices
![Questions default](images/question_default.png)

Question's textboxes can also be rounded
![Questions rounded](images/question_rounded.png)

And I think you understand that you can also change color of question's text, so I didn't put picture of this

## How to build

At first, install NodeJS :)

Install gulp globally using npm
```
npm install gulp -g
```

Go to a project folder and install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Build all using gulp
```
gulp build
```

P.S. If you want to see more gulp tasks just do `gulp help`

## How to run example

There are two ways to do it:
* Boring if you think that you're just user
* Funny if you think that you're more than user

Boring way:

Just go to exaple folder and open 'index.html' using your browser



Funny way:

Install gulp globally using npm
```
npm install gulp -g
```

Go to a project folder and install all requirements
```
npm install
```

Run `default` gulp task to rebuild all
```
gulp default
```

or run just webserver

```
gulp webserver
```

then open your browser and go to localhost:8000

## How to use
Coming soon!

## TODO
For help:
* *Realizeable* - functions that we can create in a short period of time
* *Unrealzeable* - we need to think and code very much to get this functions done

Realizeable:
* *Fix* name and text positioning
* *Fix* characters display on mobile devices
* *Add* default configs to all types
* *Add* 'active' state of **Question**'s choice
* *Add* text color changing to **Question**

Unrealizeable:
* *Fix* text positioning on mobile devices in album orientation
* *Add* opportunity to put images as a textboxes
* Increase performance
